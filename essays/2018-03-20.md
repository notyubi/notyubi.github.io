## Overview
The Problem: Some students struggle through classes without an efficient way to communicate with their classmates. Others simply don't have time to meet up with their professors or classmates one-on-one making it harder to collaborate.

The Solution: TitleInTheWorks will provide a platform for students to easily communicate with others who are taking, have taken, or are teaching the class to do better in the class. Students can post tips on how to pass the class, solutions that works but the professor hadn't covered, and exam-taking and studying advice.
