I initially selected to pursue Computer Science on a whim. I have a lot to thank my past self for that. Although I struggled intensively in the beginning, I never wanted to change my major. I took a break off during a semester and reassessed exactly what I wanted to achieve with a CS degree. 

At first, I wanted to focus on game development then bioinformatics then computational economics (this is where I added my second major: Economics) then web development (this is due to my web internship) and finally I know with clarity what I want to do: I want to develop technologies and applications to aid in a sustainable future. I believe plenty of our world's problems can be tackled if we focus on environmental issues.
