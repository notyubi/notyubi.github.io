While I was studying abroad at Kyoto University in Japan, I took a project-based data class where the focus was a project of our choosing and using python to analyze data. I chose to analyze various data on Japan to create data visualizations since I believe it is incredibly easier to understand. I selected data sets that are organized by prefectures because I wanted to see how each prefecture differed from each other. I used plotly, numpy, and matplotlib to create the different visualizations. Main goal was to organize the data in different types of ways so I created basic line plots, scatter plots, histograms, and bubble maps. Additionally, I made the data interactive since I believe data is easier to consume if it is interactive so I created widgets to adjust the time period, which prefecture to view, search bar and etc.

Data sets used:
-Duration of weather per prefecture
- Education levels per prefecture
- Electric power consumpation per prefecture
- Immigration per prefecture
- Population per prefecture
