Grub 'n' Go is a web application built for ICS 314: Software Engineering. The web app was created using Javascript React, HTML, and CSS. The primary goal of Grub 'n' Go is to provide students of University of Hawaii at Manoa a convenient way to locate food locations on/near campus. There is a list of vendors that give insight on what is currently available on their menu, hours of operation, and their location. The app also has a twiter feed embedded to allow students to keep up to date with the vendors. This way, vendors can update their status if they are closing soon, have limited specials, or sold out on a particular item.

  My contribution to this project were helping to create the initial mockups of our project, developing the vendors list, updating our website and understanding how to use google maps for react. I have learned a lot throughout this project. The most important thing I have learned is that nobody knows 100% what they are doing from beginning to end. All through my undergrad computer science career, I always thought my classmates picked up programming concepts with ease and able to code without much difficulty, resulting in me feeling like I was the only one constantly struggling. But working with my group, I realized it did not come super easy to them as I thought. They just worked harder (and failed harder) to grasp the material.
